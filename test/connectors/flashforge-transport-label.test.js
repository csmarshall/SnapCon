// test/connectors/flashforge-transport-label.test.js — reporting WHICH
// protocol a FlashForge printer is actually being driven over.
//
// A FlashForge runs either its stock API on :8898 or, once a firmware mod is
// installed, Moonraker on :7125. SnapCon detects which and silently changes
// what it can do accordingly — but until now nothing in the UI ever said
// which one it settled on, even though the Settings hint promises "SnapCon
// normally detects which is live and re-checks if it changes".
//
// What is reported is the TRANSPORT, never the mod. SnapCon cannot tell ZMOD
// from Forge-X: printStartOverridden (flashforge-adventurer.js) is a probe for
// one overridden macro and is explicitly tri-state with null-for-unknown, and
// the zmod_ifs_* objects the AD5X looks for only exist when an IFS unit is
// fitted. Labelling a card "ZMOD" off either would be presenting an inference
// as a printer-reported fact (CLAUDE.md section 2).
