// test/firmwareInventory.test.js — /api/firmware's per-printer probe.
//
// The bug this pins down, reported live on a 24-printer fleet: the Firmware
// tab sat on "Reading firmware from idle printers…" forever and never showed
// a list. Timing each printer individually found two that never answered —
// both FlashForge, both offline:
//
//   14 x U1                 0.1-0.4s
//   3 x Creality            0.4-0.5s
//   Bambu P2S               0s
//   5M PRO (flashforge)     never returned
//   AD5X ZMOD (flashforge)  never returned (>150s)
//
// Three things combined to make one unreachable printer hang the whole tab:
//
//  1. probeFirmware gated on the METHOD existing (`if (!c.getFirmwareInfo)`)
//     rather than the declared capability. FlashForge declares
//     firmwareInfo:false in native mode but still exports getFirmwareInfo as
//     defence in depth, so it was called anyway.
//  2. That export is moonrakerOnly(), which awaits currentMode() ->
//     mode.detect() against an unreachable printer. It never returns, and it
//     is wrapped in try/catch, so it never rejects either — it just hangs.
//  3. The route awaited Promise.all over every printer with no per-printer
//     bound, so one unsettled promise meant no response at all. Ever.
//
// Failure isolation over aggregate speed (CLAUDE.md section 6): one printer
// that stops answering must cost one row, not the whole inventory.
